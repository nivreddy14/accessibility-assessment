# Development
*Note that to date this project has only been developed on Mac OSX.*

## Pre-requisites
For local development you will need to satisfy the following pre-reqs:
- Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install), v19.x or above;
- set your `WORKSPACE` environment variable, and ensure that this project is cloned in the root of the workspace.  i.e. ${WORKSPACE}/accessibility-assessment

## Updating axe and vnu versions
To update the versions of axe (axe-core, axe-core/cli) and/or vnu (vnu-jar), update the version number specified within
the [package.json](package.json) file and then follow the steps [here](#building-and-running-the-image-locally-during-development)

`axe-core` requires chromedriver. The [.npmrc](.npmrc) file specifies a npm config property which detects compatibility
of the currently installed chromedriver version before installing a new version. Further information on this npm config
property can be found here https://www.npmjs.com/package/chromedriver

## Updating page-accessibility-check.jar
>If there are no changes introduced to [page-accessibility-check](https://github.com/hmrc/page-accessibility-check) then this step can be skipped.

To include any changes made to page-accessibility-check into accessibility-assessment Docker image:
* Follow the instructions in page-accessibility-check [README.md](https://github.com/hmrc/page-accessibility-check#buildingdistributing-the-project)
to generate a new jar.
* Copy the jar from `page-accessibility-check/target/scala-2.12/` into 
`accessibility-assessment/accessibility-assessment-service/app/resources/` folder.

## Building and running the image locally during development
The repository uses a [Makefile](Makefile) to build and run the accessibility-assessment image. 
The Dockerfile also includes a step to RUN npm tests when building the image. 

To build and run the accessibility-assessment container locally, use command:
```makefile
make run_local
```
To list all the available options, run:

```makefile
make
```

## Running accessibility-assessment-service tests locally during development
accessibility-assessment-service includes a set of unit, integration and e2e tests. The tests
have been implemented for  using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

To run the tests locally:

```
npm install
## runs npm test for accessibility-assessment service when building the image. \
## --runInBand ensures the tests are run in sequence
npm run test -- --runInBand
```

## Updating the image
Most updates can be tested easily by starting the service in your local development environment by executing `node app.js` from the [accessibility-assessment-service/app](accessibility-assessment-service/app/) directory.  However, triggering page assessments requires that you have specific versions of axe-cli and the vnu jar installed and configured appropriately.

As the [Dockerfile](docker/Dockerfile) contains all of the setup/configuration required to get the service running as it would in CI, the most reliable way to develop and test the service is by mounting appropriate files/folders in the [accessibility-assessment-service/app](accessibility-assessment-service/app) directory to the running docker container.

# Testing
## Postman Collection
There is a [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) collection in the [test](test/postman-collections) directory which contains a list of basic requests for each of the endpoints implemented in the service.

## Acceptance tests
The [accessibility-assessment-tests](https://github.com/hmrc/accessibility-assessment-tests) project contains captured pages from approximately 5 sample builds taken from CI which make a valueable regression test, and can be used to identify the addition/removal of rules when upgrading axe and vnu.

There is also a performance test available which ensures that builds of ~350 pages can be assessed successfully.

## Troubleshooting accessibility-assessment locally

### accessibility-assessment logs
The accessibility-assessment container logs are surfaced from two different sources:
* accessibility-assessment-service
* page-accessibility-check

#### accessibility-assessment-service logs
The logs from accessibility-assessment-service includes information about pages captured and the status of accessibility-assessment-service.
These logs can be obtained from the [GET api/logs/app](README.md#GET api/logs/app) API. This does not include the logs 
generated when assessing the page using Axe and VNU. For logs from Axe and VNU see [page-accessibility-check logs](#page-accessibility-check-logs).

accessibility-assessment-service log can also be accessed by using the docker command where `a11y` is the container name.
```bash
docker logs a11y
```
To follow these logs during an assessment:
```bash
docker logs -f a11y
```
#### page-accessibility-check logs
The logs from [page-accessibility-check](https://github.com/hmrc/page-accessibility-check) includes the logs generated 
when assessing the pages with Axe and VNU.  

Viewing this logs locally requires running the Docker [exec](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/exec/) 
command in the running a11y container. The below command creates a new Bash session in the container.

```bash
#executes an interactive bash shell on the container.
docker exec -it a11y /bin/bash 
```
The logs then can be accessed as below.

```bash
cat output/accessibility-assessment-parser.log 
```
Sample output from `PageAccessibilityCheck` logger.

### Raw output from Axe and VNU
The output generated by page-accessibility-check is a normalised output generated from the raw Axe and VNU output.
The raw output from Axe and VNU for each page are made available alongside the captured page. The API
[GET /api/report/bundle](README.md#GET api/report/<type>) returns a zipped file which contains all the captured pages,
and the HTML report. The downloaded zip files includes a folder titled `pages` which contains the capture page and 
the raw `vnu-report.json` and `axe-report.json`

This can be viewed from within the container as well, by using the interactive shell.

```bash
#executes an interactive bash shell on the container.
docker exec -it a11y /bin/bash
ls pages 
```
The `pages` directory contain all the pages captured during the assessment in a folder named after the captured timestamp.
Each of these folders include the raw `vnu-report.json` and `axe-report.json` for that page.

## Kibana Integration
### Running up an ELK stack locally

>Integration with Kibana is not an actively supported feature at present. See `PLATUI-1228`. The below steps can be used
for testing Kibana integration locally when any active work is planned.

You will need to have ~6GB of memory allocated to your local docker engine to run the ELK stack.  If you're running Docker Desktop, you can configure this in **Docker -> Preferences**

You will also need to have docker-compose installed (tested on Mac OSX with v1.25.2).

Simply navigate to the [elk](test/elk) directory and execute the command: `docker-compose up -d`

ElasticSearch and Kibana will start on the default ports of 9600 and 5601 respectively.  You will be able to see Kibana in your browser if you navigate to http://localhost:5601.  Note that it may take a minute to initialise.

To kill the stack, execute `docker-compose kill` from the [elk](test/elk) directory.  If you wish to delete all of the data ingested by elk, then delete the esdata directory `rm -r test/elk/esdata/*`

### Visualising Violations in Kibana
Visualisations for the local Kibana instance can be loaded manually using Kibana's Saved Object import UI.  If this is
the first time you've run the `docker-compose` command in the previous section, then please follow the below instructions
to generate the visualisations you'll need to review the results of the assessment:

1. When the log ingestion is successful, Kibana will show the option to create an Index at **Management -> Index Patterns**.
   The index pattern could be set to `logstash-*` and set the *time filter* field to `testRun` when prompted.
2. The exported accessibility dashboards from Management Kibana environment is available [here](https://github.com/hmrc/management-kibana-dashboards/tree/main/saved-objects/management). The current
   local ELK stack setup does not support `.raw` type used in Kibana Management. It supports only type `.keyword`. Hence,
   before importing these objects replace all references to `.raw` type in the exported saved object with `.keyword`
3. Import the modified saved objects by navigating to **Management -> Saved Ojbects** and click **Import**.
4. When prompted to choose an index pattern, select the index pattern created above in step 1
5. Upon successful import, the dashboards can be found under **Dashboard** section
